# Thai Type

This program originally began as a way to learn the ปัตตะโชติ keyboard
layout, but has grown into an experiment to see what it would look
like to write Racket programs in a subset of Racket that has been
translated into Thai.

Since I'm still very much a beginner I have left romanization comments
in place, and in places translation comments. In the `init` function,
give it a list of which rows you want to practice. (Shifted rows are
represented as 4+ the row number.) After ten mistakes, the round is over.
